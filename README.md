# YouTube Data Harvesting and Visualization
 - A Streamlit application that enables users to access and analyze data from multiple YouTube channels. I utilized Python, the YouTube Data API v3, MongoDB, MySQL, and Streamlit. 
## Python
- I used the Python programming language for this project because Python allows for data frames and various packages to connect to MongoDB and MySQL. Additionally, you can build a web app using Streamlit with Python
## Youtube Data API v3
- The YouTube Data API is accessed through the Google API library. Initially, you need to create an account on Google and log in to the Google Developer Console. Then, you have to enable the YouTube Data API, and from there, you can obtain a unique API key. With this API key, you can gather information about YouTube channels, videos, and even comments. Please ensure that you use the 'googleapiclient' package to connect it to Python.
